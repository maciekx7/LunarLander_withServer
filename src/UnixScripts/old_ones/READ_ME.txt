If you want to use one of this scripts, you have to either:

check path on the script -> it will not work for now, because it's looking for java files ONE folder previous, so it will be "UnixScripts" folder now. If you want to use this scripts from active folder, add extra line "cd ../" and and it will work.

Or

Replace one of your desired script to previous folder.
